## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a database-backed website that will help expand a person's music catalogue.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at The University of Sheffield in my third year for a Bachelor's degree.

ğŸ“ˆ This is not the end. Far from it! Still got more contributions to make, repositories to fill up and expertise to gain! Just wait..
